# Project 6 FeederReader
Joffrey Williams


FeederReader tests your code to ensure the Code functions as Expected.

To test your code:

Open Your index.html file in your browser.

If your code is operating as expected Jasmine will show you the number of specs with the number of
failures as zero.

If your code is not operating as expected Jasmine will show you number of specs along with the number
of failed specs and indicate what line of code is in failure.
